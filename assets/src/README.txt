The provided "sponza_with_ship.obj" model combines 
  - A modified version of the Crytek Sponza Model
  - A modified ship model

The modified scene was produced with Blender.

## Crytek Sponza:

Modifications include simplifying the materials to include a single diffuse
texture (and optional mask). Additionally, some of the geometry has been
slightly adjusted.

The original model is Â© 2010 Frank Meinl / Crytek and was released under the

The model used to be available at

but has since been removed.

Copies of the model can be found in various places. In particular, Morgan
McGuire maintains an updated version at

## Ship Model

The ship model is sourced from 

"TDA 362/DIT223 Tutorials"
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/TDA362/tutorials/index.html

with permission from the tutorial's authors.

Some of the models have been imported into Blender and re-exported. This
process causes object's meshes with identical materials to be merged.
